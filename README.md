#Quiz Board
This website is a short quiz to test how much students of the after school computer class have grasped after finishing a course on JavaScript. It contains carefully selected and tricky questions that will gauge how much they have learnt during the course.It's a multiple choice quiz with eight questions that are graded differently. Each question is 15 marks and the maximum a student can score is 120 (15*8).
